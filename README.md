# Consensus Raft Demo

A basic raft toy demo with accompanied tests.

# Setup

Both a `requirements.txt` and `Pipfile` are provided. I recommend using Python 3.9 and installing `pipenv` via `pip install pipenv`.

Note: Alternatively you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# Tests
Either `pipenv run pytest` or `pytest` depending on how you chose to set up the project.
